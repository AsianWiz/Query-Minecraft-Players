# Query-Minecraft-Players
Public PHP code that queries the amount of Minecraft players on an IP.


<h2>status.class.php</h2>
Core PHP file by Julian Spravil. Do NOT edit this file; it is not necessary.


<h2>index.php</h2>
This is your main website file. Make sure it has .php at the end. This code is meant for Bungee.
You would replace us.mineplex.com, eu.mineplex.com, and us.the-nebula.net with your servers in your Bungee network.

This DOES NOT work with ports. PHP code with ports is releasing soon.
Wherever you want to put the live number of players, put <?php echo $players; ?> . Whether that be in a navbar, in the middle of your webpage, it doesn't matter. The result is the same.


<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
Hope you all enjoy this PHP script.

If you want to order a website from me, as I am a web developer, you can contact me on my Skype.<br>

Please bear in mind the wait list, and the amount of time you would be waiting: http://the-nebula.net/miles/wait.

I do have my limits as well. I specialize in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS); while PHP isn't my strongest point, I do do a little.

That's about it!<br>
Cheers,<br>
Miles.
