# Query Minecraft Players
Public PHP code that queries the amount of Minecraft players on an IP.


<h2>status.class.php</h2>
Core PHP file. Do NOT edit this file; it is not necessary.


<h2>index.php</h2>
This is your main website file. Make sure it has .php at the end. This code is meant for Bungee.

This DOES NOT work with ports. PHP code with ports is releasing soon.
Wherever you want to put the live number of players, put <?php echo $players; ?> . Whether that be in a navbar, in the middle of your webpage, it doesn't matter. The result is the same.
